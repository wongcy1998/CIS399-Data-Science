Our authors to choose from are these three:\n","<ol>\n","<li>EAP - Edgar Allen Poe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe): American writer who wrote poetry and short stories that revolved around tales of mystery and the grisly and the grim. Arguably his most famous work is the poem - \"The Raven\" and he is also widely considered the pioneer of the genre of the detective fiction.</li>\n","<p>\n","<li>HPL - HP Lovecraft (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft): Best known for authoring works of horror fiction, the stories that he is most celebrated for revolve around the fictional mythology of the infamous creature \"Cthulhu\" - a hybrid chimera mix of Octopus head and humanoid body with wings on the back.</li>\n","<p>\n","<li>MWS - Mary Shelley (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley): Seemed to have been involved in a whole panoply of literary pursuits - novelist, dramatist, travel-writer, biographer. She is most celebrated for the classic tale of Frankenstein where the scientist Frankenstein a.k.a \"The Modern Prometheus\" creates the Monster that comes to be associated with his name.</li>\n","</ol>\n","<p>\n","What we have is a table of sentences from their books. Each sentence is labeled with the author who wrote it. Given a new sentence our job is to predict who the author is of that sentence.\n","<p>\n","The sentences are all jumbled up, i.e., we do not have paragraph or chapter level info.\n","  <p>\n","This identification problem actually comes from a site called kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification. Do you know about kaggle? It is a very useful site. They hold all kinds of machine learning contests. We will look at another later in the quarter.\n","\n","<p>\n","<h2>Why is this interesting?</h2>\n","<p>\n","One application of this style of analysis is in literary studies. An ancient book is found but the author is unknown. Or perhaps the author is known but there is a suspicion that someone else ghost wrote it. Or even looking at plagiarism: some portions of a book by author X look like they were lifted from author Y.\n","<p>\n","Let's bring in the table and look at it. But first, grab your functions from last week.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"j_GdU8ACeitW","colab_type":"code","outputId":"80b1c846-6861-4dce-ff95-39d3576a2121","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580291906761,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":2320,"user":{"displayName":"Future Deus","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDA38nWUBTrQ7no755EmiqFEck1JlL77eTTYOhS=s64","userId":"11509427916790811607"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36}},"source":["#flush the old directory\n","!rm -r  'w20_ds_library'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["rm: cannot remove 'w20_ds_library': No such file or directory\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rPISZH5nclhU","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["my_github_name = 'FutureDeus'  #replace with your account name"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NuaxZXKXcrNL","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["clone_url = f'https://github.com/{my_github_name}/w20_ds_library.git'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"Rmp86ySdkr4z","outputId":"041bacd1-ceff-495a-dcb0-f50be8430907","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580291908928,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":4468,"user":{"displayName":"Future Deus","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDA38nWUBTrQ7no755EmiqFEck1JlL77eTTYOhS=s64","userId":"11509427916790811607"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":129}},"source":["#get the latest.\n","!git clone $clone_url \n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Cloning into 'w20_ds_library'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 29, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (29/29), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (28/28), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 29 (delta 16), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\u001b[K\n","Unpacking objects: 100% (29/29), done.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"9r8-rTeMkr5C","colab":{}},"source":["from w20_ds_library import *"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kR8P_S3_TpZs","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###New table"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"l2zPiD43qVbZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","gothic_table = pd.read_csv('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqRwyE0ceZREKqhuaOw8uQguTG6Alr5kocggvAnczrWaimXE8ncR--GC0o_PyVDlb-R6Z60v-XaWm9/pub?output=csv',\n","                          encoding='utf-8')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-qMzRmfyq6DY","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)  #force all of sentence to be shown"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yWl9U_iyqVbc","colab_type":"code","outputId":"26fcf3e7-8f03-4244-f8e6-f60b4236fa14","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580291910637,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6155,"user":{"displayName":"Future Deus","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDA38nWUBTrQ7no755EmiqFEck1JlL77eTTYOhS=s64","userId":"11509427916790811607"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":271}},"source":["gothic_table.head()\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>author</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>id26305</td>\n","      <td>This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon;

We will start to use the nltk package this week. nltk is like pandas in that it has lots of functions, but now for doing a wide array of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. For now, I know that nltk has a built-in set of words that are very common. They are called \"stop words\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words). The general idea is that we want to delete these words from a sentence before doing any analysis. If you want an analogy, it would be like removing common charaters from last week. For instance, the letters 'a' and 'e' are common. We could ignore them by leaving them out of the intersection set, e.g.,\n","<pre>\n","set(tweet0).intersection(set('bcdfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!#'))\n","</pre>\n","\n","Let's get the stop words defined by nltk.

Sometimes referred to as the French Newton or Newton of France, he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of his contemporaries. He was Napoleon's examiner when Napoleon attended the École Militaire in Paris in 1784. Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806 and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration.\n","Laplace died in Paris in 1827. His brain was removed by his physician, François Magendie, and kept for many years, eventually being displayed in a roving anatomical museum in Britain. It was reportedly smaller than the average brain.</i>\n","\n","Laplace was also into thought experiments. He was thinking about the probability that the sun would **not** rise in the morning.\n","His thought was that given a large sample of days with the rising sun, we still can not be completely sure that it will rise tomorrow. So the probability of it not rising is not zero, even though we have no evidence of it to date. He proposed adding a small smoothing constant to each conditional probability. In essence, he did not like probablities of 0. He thought a 0 led to us thinking we knew more than we actually did.\n","\n"]}]}
