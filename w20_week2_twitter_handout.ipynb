They want to know if someone is angry or not, if someone likes their product or not, if information is fake or not, if someone is breaking the rules for posting. I'd like to look at twitter in this module, and see if we can classify a tweet as carrying a hate message. I was able to round up a dataset of roughly 32K tweets in csv format, i.e., same format we used to look at passenger names on the Titanic. And the tweets are already labeled, just as Titanic data was labeled. \n","<p>\n","Let's bring in the tweets then talk about them.

There is a more preferred measure for dealing with text analytics: cosine similarity. The general idea is that we view an n-vector as a line in n-space. Given 2 such vectors, we can determine their cosine similarity. This is from a (free!) online book that gives some good examples: see page 121 here https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/06vect.pdf. We won't really need the cosine method until later but might as well start practicing with it now.\n","<p>\n","As a side note, for NLP problems there is often similarity between features. For instance, we expect 'q' and 'u' to co-occur. In this case, we might want something slightly more complicated: the soft cosine measure (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity#Soft_cosine_measure). We may get back to this if time.\n","<p>\n","Implement the function. And no libraries for this please.
