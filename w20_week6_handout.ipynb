With `word_distances`, we are taking a target word and looking at its row vector. What is the row vector? It is the count of other words in  proximity of that word in all the sentences. So it represents \"the company the word keeps\". We now ask what other words keep similar company. If 2 words appear a lot together, that will make them similar. But they can also be similar if they never appear together. Instead, they appear with the same company often. For instance, take \"*Once in a blue moon.*\" and \"*A blue dog democrat.*\" Even if *moon* and *dog* may never appear together, they will be related through the *blue* column. So moon and dog will have some similarity. Kind of interesting.\n","  <p>\n","  \n","If we have time in the quarter, I'd like to follow up on the next step we can take once we have the comax. The general idea is that the comax is a very sparse matrix, consisting of mostly 0 entries. And as you have seen, it takes time to search it. There are linear-algebra  techniques for reducing a sparse matrix into a more dense matrix and hence, making them more computationally tractable to work with. One in particular is Singular-Value Decomposition (or SVD): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition. This is used with the Glove algorithm to take a comat, exactly like the one you built, and reduce it: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. You end up with a matrix of the same number of rows (one for each word) but roughly 300 columns (instead of 25K).  It's like magic!\n","<p>\n","This type of reduction is called \"word embedding\". It is like the 300 columns somehow capture the essence of the word in terms of its use in the context of a sentence. You can do some cool things with it. For instance, you can take the reduced vector for \"king', subtract the reduced vector for 'male' and get the resulting vector for 'queen'. It is too wild.\n","\n","I hope we can get to it toward the end of the quarter.\n","</div>"]}]}
