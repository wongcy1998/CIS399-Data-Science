Here is the big picture.\n","\n","1. We choose n random leaders  from the crowd table. A good value for n is the square root of the length of the crowd table. Build a new table of these n leaders.

Go through each follower and find its closest leader using the normal distance function. Keep a separate mapping from leader to all of its followers. When we are finished, each follower will be associated with one and only one leader. Each leader will have m or more followers. If a leader has less than m followers, we drop it from the mapping, i.e., it will not be in play in the next step. The value of m will be a parameter.\n","\n","4. We are now ready for testing. Go through the testing table. For each row, find its closest leader. Then get the followers of that leader using the mapping from step 3. Those followers are your new and much reduced crowd table.
