The purpose of KNN is, given a row we want to know something about (I'll call it the target row), find other rows that are similar to it. I suppose it is a bit like trying to find a good Italian restaurant by saying \"who in this crowd likes Italian food?. Then asking who ever raises their hand for a recommendation of a good restaurant. You could take a vote among the recommenders. That is not a totally accurate analogy but is close.\n","  <p>\n","    The crowd we will ask questions of are the rows in name_table. I guess you could call it the row-crowd. What we want to know (i.e., our restaurant recommendation) is the `Survived` column. In essence, we will ask our expert rows what value they have for Survived. We will tally their values and use\n","    majority wins. If our experts say yes (actually a 1), then that' will be the value we will use. How do these experts get identified? We are coming to that.\n","    <p>\n","      The problem at the moment is that we don't have much to go on in terms of identifying our experts. The only column we have is `Length`. It would be similar to us asking our dining-out crowd \"who in this crowd goes out to eat?\". It is helpful but would be better if we had more information to filter on. So let's add some more features. We will see a technique called bag-of-words in a future module. The general idea is to collect together all the words you see in a set of documents and give each a unique integer id. Then add  columns labeled with the word ids and the cells with their counts. In this challenge, I want you to try bag-of-characters (I just made that name up - I might trademark it). I want 26 new columns, one for each letter. For each row['Name'], I want a count of how many times each letter appears in the name. You could do this the tedious way and have 26 separate pieces of code. What I want to see is a loop that does it for you.\n","<p>\n","Please wrangle the Name string into lowercase. I think this is an iffy decision. It may be that uppercase letters carry information. Normalizing to lowercase washes that information out. It would really be no problem to have 52 new columns for upper and lower case. Or even add columns for punctuation. Adding columns is cheap and easy. But we will use lowercase for now. And remove punctuation.\n","<p>\n","To remind you of what we did in content notebook:\n","<pre>\n","<code>\n","name_table['Length'] = name_table.apply(lambda row: len(row['Name']), axis=1)\n","</code>\n","</pre>\n","<p>\n","What you need is to do the same for 26 new columns.

This will set it up as a git folder.\n","5. Add the  functions we defined this week to your library.\n","\n","Why is step 4 optional? Because you could choose to just maintain your file on github. Make changes to it there without ever needing your local machine. But I think it is good practice to make changes on your local machine then use git commands to push those changes to github. Plus you can use your favorite editor and linter from your local machine. But it is up to you.\n","\n","Important point: you will need to import any libraries you need at the top of the file. This is tricky. A module has its own namespace. Even if you have something like `import pandas as pd` in your main notebook, that will not be seen from your module. Your module has to be self-contained. You can see I have done this in `w20_ds_library.py`.\n","\n","Finally, I can run the code below to pull down my file to colab and then import it. Pretty cool.
